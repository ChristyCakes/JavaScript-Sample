## JavaScript Coding Sample

This repository contains a small application that consumes test score data and exposes the data via a REST API.  I have built a UI on top of the API with a simple wireframe given to me for a coding evaluation. I can take credit for all front end files as well as in the Express API.

### About the application

The application consumes data from `http://live-test-scores.herokuapp.com/scores`, using the [Server-Sent Events](https://www.w3.org/TR/2015/REC-eventsource-20150203/) protocol and stores the results in memory.


### About the tools

This project shows my knowledge of vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. There are no 3rd-party libraries or frameworks used. Please see my other repositories for code examples in React, Material UI, Bootstrap, etc. or request a sample of work I've completed for my current employer.
